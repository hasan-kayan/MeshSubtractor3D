# Three.js Geometry Classes with CSG

This project provides a set of utility classes that extend the functionality of Three.js geometries with Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) capabilities, using the three-csg-ts library. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface for performing complex geometry operations such as union, subtraction, and intersection.

##Â Features
Classes for each Three.js geometry type.
Methods to perform CSG operations.
Examples of common geometry manipulations.
Easy integration into existing Three.js projects.
## Installation
To use these classes in your project, you need to have Three.js and three-csg-ts installed. If you haven't already set up a Three.js project, you can start with the Three.js documentation.

### Installing Dependencies

- npm install three
- npm install three-csg-ts

### Including the Classes
Download the geometry classes from this repository and include them in your project directory.
